        "title": "Where I'm From",
        "body": "I was born and raised in the Netherlands. My parents worked hard to give me and my brother the room to figure things out. I spent countless hours behind a screen tinkering with code and games—time well spent, in hindsight."

        "title": "What I Used to Do",
        "body": "My first jobs weren't glamorous. I stocked shelves and tried a mix of roles that taught me a lot about people. Eventually I leaned into tech—building side projects, taking on freelance work, and seeing how software could make daily work simpler."

      "present": {
        "title": "What I Do Now",
        "body": "Today, I'm a mid-level software engineer working at <dictu>@DICTU</dictu>. On the side I experiment with new tools and libraries, building prototypes that make products more human and less cumbersome."

      "life": {
        "title": "Where I'm At Now",
        "body": "I live in Gouda, balancing work, hobbies, and side projects. When I'm not coding, you'll usually find me at the gym (or convincing myself to go), or spending time with friends and family."

      "future": {
        "title": "What I'm Looking For",
        "body": "Opportunities to build thoughtful products with great teams. I believe software should remove friction, not add it—especially for trades and small businesses. There's still plenty of old tooling waiting to be improved."
